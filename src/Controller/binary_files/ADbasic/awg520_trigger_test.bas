' AWG520_Trigger_Test.bas
' This process generates trigger pulses to control AWG520 external triggering
' for testing the ADwin→AWG520 control architecture.
'
' Hardware Setup:
' - ADwin Digital Output → AWG520 TRIG IN (rear panel)
' - AWG520 configured for external trigger with Wait Trigger enabled
' - Computer controls JUMP_MODE software for sequence advancement
'
' Operation:
' - Process generates trigger pulses at specified intervals
' - Each trigger causes AWG520 to advance to next sequence line
' - Computer can control timing and number of triggers via parameters
' This is the new approach: adwin triggers awg to move to next task/line
